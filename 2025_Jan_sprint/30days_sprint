Week 2: Intermediate Concepts
Day 8: Strings
Write a program to reverse a string and check if it is a palindrome.
Explore basic string manipulation functions.
Day 9: Pointers
Practice with pointers by swapping two variables' values.
Create a program to demonstrate pointer arithmetic.
Day 10: Dynamic Memory
Use new and delete to create a program that allocates memory for an array at runtime.
Day 11: Structures
Define a struct for a student record (name, age, grades) and create a program to display the records.
Day 12: File Handling
Build a program to read and write data to a file.
Save and display student records using file handling.
Day 13: Project: Expense Tracker
Build a console-based expense tracker:
Add, view, and delete expense entries.
Save and load data from a file.
Day 14: Debugging
Learn to use debugging tools.
Refactor and debug the expense tracker project.
Week 3: Advanced Concepts
Day 15: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
Create a class for a bank account with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.
Day 16: Inheritance
Extend the bank account program to include different account types (e.g., savings, current).
Day 17: Polymorphism
Implement function overloading and overriding in the bank account project.
Day 18: Exception Handling
Add error handling to the bank account project (e.g., withdrawal greater than balance).
Day 19: STL Basics
Learn to use vector and map from the Standard Template Library.
Create a program to count the frequency of words in a string.
Day 20: Project: Library Management System
Build a basic library management system:
Add and search for books.
Issue and return books.
Use file handling for data persistence.
Day 21: Refactor Library Management System
Refactor the code to improve structure and readability.
Add exception handling for invalid inputs.
Week 4: Advanced Topics and Final Projects
Day 22: Templates
Create a program demonstrating function templates and class templates.
Day 23: Smart Pointers
Explore smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) and their applications.
Day 24: Multithreading
Write a program that demonstrates the use of threads to run multiple tasks simultaneously.
Day 25: Networking
Use basic socket programming to create a client-server program (if applicable to your environment).
Day 26: Optimization
Optimize the library management system for performance and readability.
Profile and debug the code using tools.
Day 27: Project: Mini Game
Build a console-based game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe or Snake):
Use OOP and STL.
Include basic graphics using ASCII art.
Day 28: Refactor and Debug Mini Game
Add additional features (e.g., score tracking or multiplayer).
Debug and test thoroughly.
Day 29: Final Review
Revisit key topics and concepts.
Test your understanding by solving coding challenges or quizzes.
Day 30: Final Project
Choose a project that integrates all learned concepts:
Examples: Inventory management system, chat application, or advanced game.
Plan, design, implement, and test the project.
Tips for Success
Document your code and maintain clean, readable formatting.
Version Control: Use Git to track changes in your projects.
Practice Regularly: Focus on understanding concepts, not just completing projects.
Reflect and Iterate: Review your progress and refine projects as you go.
Good luck, Alex! ðŸŽ¯
